==  ⦁   Use case – Connectivity with salesforce

This use-case demonstrates the interaction between Splunk and Salesforce systems using SPUNK connector. It utilises POST, GET and DELETE operations connectors.

For running this use-case we need following configurations as prerequisites:

⦁ Drag and drop an HTTP Listener in the canvas.

⦁ In the Listener properties, give a path you want to use to trigger the listener.

⦁ Add a new Configuration as follows,

image:img/HTTP_Listener_Config.png[]

⦁ Test the connection and click on Okay.

⦁ Make sure your mule palette has Salesforce and Splunk modules. If you do not have Salesforce module in your palette, go to add module -> Salesforce and drag it to your palette.

⦁ Now add configurations for Splunk.

⦁ Go to global-configurations.xml global elements -> create -> Connector Configuration -> Splunk Configuration

⦁ Add following properties.

    Baseurl : (Example : http://localhost:8089)

    Username :

    Password :

    Connection timeout :

    Connection Idle Timeout :

⦁	Add Salesforce configuration.
⦁	Go to global-configurations.xml -> global elements -> create -> Connector Configuration -> Salesforce Configuration
⦁	Add following properties

⦁	Create a flow with the components displayed in the image below:

== UsesCases are defined below:

== Create Index:

This  use case demonstrates the creating Index:

⦁  The flow gets started by Setting a variable name Index where we are fetching the name from query Params then Creating the Index using the Splunk create Index operation with name set in the variable, then we are again a setting variable named Index Links and using a transform message to do the transformation for Salesforce Database.

⦁  We are creating Index details in salesforce by using salesforce connector create with that payload obtained from transform message.

⦁  Atlast we are adding a transform message to get the response in JSON.

== Add Data To Index:

This  use case demonstrates adding data to the created Index i.e, updating the Index:

⦁  The flow gets started by Setting a variable name Index Name where we are fetching the name from query Params then we are retrieving  Index details by using query operation salesforce connector and then using a transform message to convert the Java response to Json.

⦁  Then we are using the add data to Index Splunk operation for updating the Index that is created before and after that we use a transform message to get the response in Json.

== Remove Index:

This  use case demonstrates removing Index that is created :

⦁  The flow gets started by Setting a variable name Index Name where we are fetching the name from query Params then we are retrieving  Index details by using query operation salesforce connector and then using a transform message to convert the Java response to Json.

⦁  Then we are using the remove Index Splunk operation for deleting  the Index that is created before and after that we use a transform message to get the response in Json.
